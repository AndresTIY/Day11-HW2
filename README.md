## Create a form
- include a 'submit' button
- when the user submits, run a FUNCTION that validates their input
- if the input is invalid, inform user that they need to fill out more information.
- if input is valid, put the input in an object and print that object to the CONSOLE
- start with ONE form with only ONE input (can multiple inputs go in a form?)YES IT can

created input, gave it id name of "fname". picked it out with document.query, saved to a var in js.
- current obstacle. when name is entered, how do you retrieve it?
